# ROB-317-Vision3D
Repository for my work over the 3rd year course ROB-317 (now CSC_5RO17_TA) - Vision 3D at ENSTA Paris

This course explores key concepts and techniques in computer vision for 3D scene reconstruction, crucial for robotic navigation—whether reactive (obstacle avoidance) or planned (environment mapping). Applications extend to digital geography and urban planning.

The course covers 3D sensors, including 3D cameras and LiDAR, with a focus on 3D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos. Analytical methods are discussed, such as multi-view geometry and homography estimation. A session is also dedicated to learning-based approaches for predicting depth maps from video.

Finally, the course addresses point cloud processing—filtering, simplifying, and aligning point clouds to complete the reconstruction.
